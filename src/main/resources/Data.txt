Jewish mortars and loudspeaker trucks shook Arab neighborhoods in early 1948 as sectarian fighting consumed the newly partitioned land that would soon become Israel. Amid the prolonged shelling, the trucks would broadcast the threatening sounds of wailing sirens, fake screams and evacuation warnings.

Returning home would prove impossible for an estimated 750,000 Palestinians and their millions of descendants. When Israeli archives opened in the 1980s, records showed how Israeli operations, including psychological-warfare broadcasts, helped drive the exodus.

“The element of surprise, long stints of shelling with extremely loud blasts, and loudspeakers in Arabic proved very effective when properly used,” reads an Israel Defense Forces intelligence report from June 1948 that called Jewish combatants “the main factor” in the exodus.
